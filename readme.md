# OBS-Zoom-To-Mouse

An OBS lua script to zoom a display-capture source to focus on the mouse. 

I made this for my own use when recording videos as I wanted a way to zoom into my IDE when highlighting certain sections of code. My particular setup didn't seem to work very well with the existing zooming solutions so I created this.

Built with OBS v29.1.3

Inspired by [tryptech](https://github.com/tryptech)'s [obs-zoom-and-follow](https://github.com/tryptech/obs-zoom-and-follow)

## Example
![Usage Demo](obs-zoom-to-mouse.gif)

## Install
1. Git clone the repo (or just save a copy of `obs-zoom-to-mouse.lua`)
1. Launch OBS
1. In OBS, add a `Display Capture` source (if you don't have one already)
1. In OBS, open Tools -> Scripts
1. In the Scripts window, press the `+` button to add a new script
1. Find and add the `obs-zoom-to-mouse.lua` script
1. For best results use the following settings on your `Display Capture` source
   * Transform:
      * Positional Alignment - `Top Left`
      * Bounding Box type -  `Scale to inner bounds`
      * Alignment in Bounding Box - `Top Left`
      * Crop - All **zeros**
   * If you want to crop the display, add a new Filter -> `Crop/Pad`
      * Relative - `False`
      * X - Amount to crop from left side
      * Y - Amount to crop form top side
      * Width - Full width of display minus the value of X + amount to crop from right side
      * Height - Full height of display minus the value of Y + amount to crop from bottom side
   
   **Note:** If you don't use this form of setup for your display source (E.g. you have bounding box set to `No bounds` or you have a `Crop` set on the transform), the script will attempt to **automatically change your settings** to zoom compatible ones. 
   This may have undesired effects on your layout (or just not work at all).

## Usage
1. You can customize the following settings in the OBS Scripts window:
   * **Zoom Source**: The display capture in the current scene to use for zooming
   * **Force transform update**: Click to refresh the internal zoom data if you manually change the transform/filters on your zoom source
   * **Zoom Factor**: How much to zoom in by
   * **Zoom Speed**: The speed of the zoom in/out animation
   * **Auto follow mouse**: True to track the cursor while you are zoomed in
   * **Follow outside bounds**: True to track the cursor even when it is outside the bounds of the source
   * **Follow Speed**: The speed at which the zoomed area will follow the mouse when tracking
   * **Follow Border**: The %distance from the edge of the source that will re-enable mouse tracking
   * **Lock Sensitivity**: How close the tracking needs to get before it locks into position and stops tracking until you enter the follow border
   * **Set manual monitor position**: True to override the calculated x,y topleft position for the selected display
   * **X**: The coordinate of the left most pixel of the display
   * **Y**: The coordinate of the top most pixel of the display
   * **Width**: The width of the display in pixels
   * **Height**: The height of the display in pixels
   * **More Info**: Show this text in the script log
   * **Enable debug logging**: Show additional debug information in the script log

1. In OBS, open File -> Settings -> Hotkeys 
   * Add a hotkey for `Toggle zoom to mouse` to zoom in and out
   * Add a hotkey for `Toggle follow mouse during zoom` to turn mouse tracking on and off (*Optional*)

## Known Limitations
* Currently this script only works on **Windows**
   * Internally it uses [FFI](https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) to get the mouse position by loading the Win32 `GetCursorPos()` function

* Only works on `Display Capture` sources
   * In theory it should be able to work on window captures too, if there was a way to get the mouse position relative to that specific window

## Development Setup
* Clone this repo
* Edit `obs-zoom-to-mouse.lua`
* Click `Reload Scripts` in the OBS Scripts window

And to anyone brave enough to use this - Good Luck!
